Plugin options
--------------

The only thing the plugin asks of you, is a valid customer ID, license key respectively, for Linguatec
Voice Reader Web and a valid TYPO3 code ID for the API source. Do not panic if you just want to test the
extension without buying a license. Just register for a free 30 day trial period. See :ref:`users-manual-free-trial-license`

When you finally got your customer ID and TYPO3 code ID set that IDs in the extension configuration of the extension [wes_reader] Voice Reader Text-to-Speech.
