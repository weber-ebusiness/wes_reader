Integration
-----------

Basically there are two ways of integrating wes_reader into your TYPO3 website. You can either
insert independent plugins on every page you want to be reader-enabled or you use one global plugin
which is built into the general template of your website using TypoScript. Either way, it's pretty
straightforward.
